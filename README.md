#### API Fetched Data: In this Python file, I explored fetching data from an API using the requests library. The process can vary depending on whether you need to retrieve data from a single page or multiple pages. Once the data is obtained, itâ€™s converted from JSON format into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis or manipulation. This approach allows for efficient handling of API responses, making it adaptable to a wide range of use cases. While the process remains relatively simple, the complexity can increase depending on the structure and size of the data received after calling the API, requiring careful consideration of pagination, rate limits, and error handling.
